# Contributing to HLA Pipeline Manager

We welcome contributions to improve the operational efficiency of this toolkit.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/parallel-check`
3.  **Make Changes**: Implement your feature (e.g., parallelizing the file check loop).
4.  **Test**: Ensure the script still correctly identifies broken batches.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe your changes and why they are needed.

## Guidelines

*   **Safety**: Deployment scripts must ALWAYS backup data before overwriting.
*   **Logging**: Scripts should provide clear, timestamped logs.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug in the deployment logic, please open an issue immediately.
